# hello-world


Hi everyone! :)

I am following the friendly Hello World GitHub guide and enjoying the site so far! I joined GitHub because I want to design a theme for a mail client I am starting to use and the how-to guide has lead me here! Wish me lucky--I hope to share other projects if I end mastering the whole coding aspect of things :) 

Thanks for reading!
